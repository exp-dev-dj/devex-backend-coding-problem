# Welcome Devex Backend Interview Questions

## Project setup

Go to your application root directory and run `npm install`

## Get familiar with the project

Your questions are under directory `./interview-questions`. You only need to try to solve the first two, q1 and q2. The third problem is really just about your past expeirence facing similar challenges. 

Run `npm run test`, you shall see failed tests.  Your goal is to finish the implementations in `./interview-questions/q1.js` and `./interview-questions/q2.js`, so all tests can pass. You can NOT modify any existing files or logic except for `q1.js` and `q2.js`.

Good luck!
